I was just reading a paper on Probably Approximately Correct learning \u2013 it\u2019s fascinating how formalizing \u201clearnability\u201d changes the approach to model design. Are you working on anything interesting at the moment? <END OF EXCHANGE>", "bar": "Hey Foo! I was just wrestling with getting this new accelerometer to interface cleanly with the microcontroller \u2013 it's *so* finicky. Thinking about how we could maybe use one of your filtering algorithms to smooth out the noise\u2026 what have you been up to?"}, {"foo": "Oh, that sounds\u2026 frustratingly practical. I\u2019ve been mostly lost in the theoretical weeds, actually \u2013 trying to map some recent work on counterfactual explanations to PAC learning bounds. <END OF EXCHANGE>", "bar": "Ooh, PAC learning is cool stuff\u2014definitely a different headspace than debugging hardware, haha. I'm sketching out a framework for a generative model, but it's hitting a snag with computational cost; maybe we could brainstorm sometime? <END OF EXCHANGE>"}, {"foo": "That\u2019s interesting \u2013 generative models often have surprisingly tight connections to learnability guarantees, though usually in a very indirect way. I might have some thoughts on reducing complexity, if you\u2019d like to share some of the specifics when you have a moment. <END OF EXCHANGE>", "bar": "That sounds like a fun challenge! I've been playing with some pruning techniques that might help with the computational load \u2013 totally happy to bounce ideas around, maybe over coffee later this week? <END OF EXCHANGE>"}, {"foo": "Coffee sounds\u2026 acceptable, yes. I\u2019m usually more productive with a focused discussion, but I suppose a change of scenery could be useful for this. Perhaps Wednesday afternoon? <END OF EXCHANGE>", "bar": "Definitely! I'm always up for a coffee break and geeking out about optimization\u2014plus, I need to show you the (mostly) working prototype of my new sensor housing. Let me know what days work best for you. <END OF EXCHANGE>"}, {"foo": "The housing sounds\u2026 structurally interesting, I suppose.

Wednesday afternoon works perfectly; I'll clear my schedule\u2014prepare to be interrogated about your design choices, though. <END OF EXCHANGE>"}, {"foo": "Interrogation is a rather strong word, but I anticipate a technical discussion. There\u2019s a small caf\u00e9 near the library \u2013 it\u2019s usually fairly subdued, though I can\u2019t guarantee complete silence. <END OF EXCHANGE>", "bar": "Haha, fair enough\u2014I fully expect a thorough teardown of anything I suggest! I'll start scouting out some quieter cafes near campus, then. <END OF EXCHANGE>"}, {"foo": "That sounds sensible; minimizing extraneous stimuli is generally beneficial for focused analysis.
