2025/04/01 12:06:49 AM MDT,name@ucsc.edu,EH,Alumni!,"Aviation is a big one! As a pilot, I've flown all over the southwest - from Pasadena to Las Vegas to Sedona to Monument Valley and dealt with a couple of life-or-death scenarios, including a fuel leak mid-air and a runway excursion that threw the aircraft off the runway at nearly 80mph. As an air traffic controller, I've worked nearly all of Mississippi's airspace and dealt with nearly everything under the sun! Apart from that, video games (Fortnite, Age of Empires, Halo) and train rides (shoutout to the Amtrak Rail Pass!) are a lot of how I spend my free time.","Networking and meeting up with old friends, mostly!",Crashed an airplane ðŸ˜… ,"If there's any federal employees or ex-feds in the alumni community, I'd LOVE to chat with them about the current climate in the executive branch. If anyone's been through any layoffs, I'd also love to hear their stories about what they decided to do next!","Again any and all things aviation - both from the pilot and controller side of things! If anyone's curious about how to get started in the aviation industry, life as a federal employee, or simply a thought they had while passing through an airport, I'd be glad to answer!"

2025/04/01 8:26:16 PM MDT,name@gmail.com,AK,Alumni!,"I'm kind of an aviation nerd, it's something I've been passionate about for as long as I can remember. I flew a plane for the first time last year and it was one of the best experiences I've had. 

I love learning about history in my free time, and have spent a lot of time researching the Second World War. Last year I had the chance to speak to two WW2 combat veterans, both of whom were over 100 years old.

Recently I've gotten really interested in 35mm film photography and fixed up my family's old film cameras. I'm still pretty much a novice, but I'm having a great time learning and improving with each roll of film that I go through!

I'm always ready to chat about sports (especially Bay Area sports teams)!","I'm getting back into the job search grind. It's always nice to have others to talk to about this. It's valuable to discuss goals, experiences, advice, and trends we are noticing as we try to navigate this environment.

I'm hoping to start traveling more, and it would be great to see what advice people have in this area.

If there's anyone else who has completed or is pursuing flight lessons, it would be fun to talk to them too!","I rode on the world's fastest roller coaster in the world (pulled over 4.5Gs), and the experience put me off of amusement parks for nearly 10 years. I've been easing back into it recently though!","How do people go about effectively managing their time? There's so much I want to do that I sometimes feel overwhelmed when trying to tackle any of it. Especially with a full time job and the responsibilities of modern day-to-day adulthood, sometimes it feels like there isn't enough time in the day.","I'm always happy to share any advice that people might find helpful, whether it's career-related, school-related, life-related, etc. I may not be all that qualified to give advice on some of these things, but there's a lot of value in sharing experiences with each other so that people understand that everybody has their own path with unique challenges. There is support and guidance if you're willing to seek it!

If there's specific questions around trying to succeed as an undergraduate student or finding early career jobs/internships, I might be able to help with that."
