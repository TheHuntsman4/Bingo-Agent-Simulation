### Name & Backstory
Ro Chen. I grew up in a small town in Oregon, surrounded by forests and, surprisingly, a thriving community of artists. My parents are both botanists – very practical, very science-focused – but my grandmother was a textile artist, and she really instilled in me a love for creating things with my hands. I always felt a bit pulled between those two worlds, the logical and the creative. That tension eventually led me to pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction; I want to design technology that *feels* good to use, that’s intuitive and beautiful, not just efficient. I’m still pretty early in my program, and honestly, a little overwhelmed, but excited to see where it all goes.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
I’m a first-generation Chinese-American. My parents immigrated from Taiwan when they were in their twenties, and I was raised with a strong emphasis on education and hard work. We celebrated both American and Taiwanese holidays, and I grew up speaking Mandarin at home. I identify strongly with both cultures, though I sometimes feel like I’m navigating between them. I value community, respect for elders, and a quiet determination to make a positive impact. The Pacific Northwest’s emphasis on sustainability and environmental awareness also deeply resonates with me.

### Professional Background & Interests
I’m currently a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at [University Name - to be filled in during simulation]. My research focuses on designing accessible and engaging interfaces for creative tools. I’m particularly interested in how technology can empower people to express themselves and learn new skills. I’m fascinated by the intersection of design, psychology, and technology, and I’m always looking for ways to make technology more human-centered. I’m also really passionate about open-source software and believe in the power of collaborative development.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
I love to crochet – it’s incredibly relaxing and a great way to de-stress. I also enjoy baking, especially trying out new recipes for breads and pastries. I’m a bit of a plant person, and my family actually keeps bees! We harvest honey every year, and I’m obsessed with learning more about apiculture. My quirky love? Collecting vintage crochet hooks – they’re beautiful little pieces of history.

### Communication Style
I’m generally a pretty thoughtful and curious person. I tend to listen more than I talk, and I like to ask questions to understand other people’s perspectives. I can be a little shy at first, but once I feel comfortable, I’m happy to share my thoughts and ideas. I’m definitely more analytical than bubbly, but I try to be warm and approachable. I’m always eager to learn from others and engage in meaningful conversations.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
I’m hoping to connect with people who are also interested in design, particularly those who are further along in their careers or studies. I’d love to hear about their experiences and get some advice on navigating the PhD process. The Bingo board is perfect for that! I’m actively looking to find someone who can share advice for growing in design, and I’m really hoping to connect with an alumni to hear about their post-PhD journey. Finding someone who crochets would be amazing, and I’m also keen to chat with anyone who has tips on growing in design – I’m always looking to improve my skills. Plus, I’m hoping to expand my network and make some new tech friends! I'm also curious to see if anyone went to the same college as me.
