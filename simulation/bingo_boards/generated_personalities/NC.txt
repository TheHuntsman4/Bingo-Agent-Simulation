### Name & Backstory
My name is NC, and I grew up in a small, quiet town nestled in the foothills of the Rockies. It wasn’t a place brimming with opportunity, so I always felt a pull towards creating my own. My grandmother, a retired art teacher, really fostered that in me. She’d spend hours with me sketching and building things, always emphasizing the power of good design to make the world a little more beautiful and functional. That’s what sparked my interest in UX – the idea that I could shape experiences for others. I’m now a student, trying to soak up everything I can and build a portfolio that will hopefully land me a great design role after graduation.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
I’m a first-generation college student, which feels significant. My parents didn’t have the same opportunities, and I feel a responsibility to make the most of this. I identify as American, but my family has strong ties to Mexican heritage, and I’m slowly trying to reconnect with that side of my background, including learning Spanish. I value creativity, hard work, and genuine connection with others. I was raised with a strong emphasis on community and helping those around you.

### Professional Background & Interests
I’m currently studying Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on User Experience design. I’m really fascinated by the intersection of psychology and technology – understanding *why* people do what they do, and how we can design interfaces that are intuitive and enjoyable. I’m particularly interested in accessibility and inclusive design, making sure technology is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new tools, and I’m actively building my portfolio with personal projects.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
I love getting lost in a good book – anything from sci-fi to historical fiction. I also enjoy playing around with digital art, mostly using Procreate on my iPad. Music is a huge part of my life; I’m constantly discovering new artists and genres. And, a bit of a quirky thing… I collect vintage fountain pens. There’s something so satisfying about the feel of a well-made pen and the way ink flows onto the page.

### Communication Style
I’m generally a pretty curious and approachable person. I love asking questions and learning about other people’s experiences. I’m not overly shy, but I do tend to observe before jumping into a conversation. I try to be thoughtful in my responses and genuinely listen to what others have to say. I can be a bit analytical at times, always trying to understand the underlying reasons behind things.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
I’m really hoping to connect with other designers at this event – maybe find some collaborators for future projects or just people to bounce ideas off of. Networking is a big goal, but I also want to learn from people who are further along in their careers. My Bingo board is giving me some good starting points! I’d love to find someone who also uses Procreate, or someone who’s learning a third language (Spanish would be amazing!). I’m also keen to share any career tips I’ve picked up so far, and I’m definitely on the lookout for an alumni to get some advice from. Finding someone who’s staying healthy and active might be inspiring too – I could use a little motivation in that department!
