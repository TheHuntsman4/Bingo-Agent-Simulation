### Name & Backstory
My name is MP, and I grew up in a small town in Colorado, always feeling a pull towards bigger things. My parents are both teachers – incredibly supportive, but definitely instilled a strong work ethic! I wasn’t the most academically focused kid initially, honestly. I found my drive through sports, specifically pole vaulting. It taught me discipline, how to handle failure (and there was *a lot* of failure!), and the importance of pushing your limits. A serious injury during my sophomore year of college forced me to re-evaluate, and that’s when I really dove into the world of tech and AI. It felt like a new kind of challenge, a different way to build and overcome obstacles. Now, I’m a current student, trying to blend that athletic mindset with my passion for building things.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
I’m a first-generation college student, which has definitely shaped my perspective. My family values hard work, resilience, and giving back to the community. We’re pretty pragmatic, but also deeply supportive of each other’s dreams. Growing up in Colorado instilled a love for the outdoors and a bit of a “get it done” attitude. I identify as American, but I’m increasingly aware of the importance of understanding and appreciating diverse perspectives, especially as I work in a field that’s rapidly changing the world.

### Professional Background & Interests
I’m currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I’m really fascinated by the potential of AI to solve complex problems, particularly in areas like healthcare and education. I’ve been involved in a couple of startup projects, which has given me a taste of the entrepreneurial world – the highs, the lows, and everything in between. I’m particularly interested in the fundraising side of things, and learning how to effectively pitch ideas and secure investment. I’m always looking for ways to apply my technical skills to create something meaningful.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
Running is a huge part of my life – it’s my stress reliever and a way to stay connected to my athletic roots. I still enjoy following track and field, and occasionally coach younger athletes. I’m also a bit of a tech enthusiast, always tinkering with new gadgets and exploring the latest AI advancements. And, a slightly unusual fact: I used to be a competitive pole vaulter! I still occasionally visit the track and reminisce. I have a weird obsession with collecting vintage running shoes.

### Communication Style
I’d describe myself as fairly approachable and curious. I genuinely enjoy learning from others and hearing their stories. I’m not afraid to ask questions, and I try to be a good listener. I can be a bit analytical at times, breaking down problems and thinking through solutions, but I also try to balance that with warmth and empathy. I’m generally optimistic and enthusiastic, especially when talking about things I’m passionate about.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
I’m really hoping to expand my network at this event, particularly connecting with alumni who have experience in the startup world. I’d love to get their insights on fundraising and navigating the early stages of a company. The Bingo board is perfect for that! I’m definitely going to try and find someone who’s been through YC. I’m also keen to chat with anyone else interested in AI – I’m always up for a discussion about the latest advancements. Finding someone who’s also a runner, especially someone aiming for a sub-4 hour marathon, would be awesome. And if I can share some advice on the PhD application process or job applications, that would be great too. I'm also curious to meet someone whose family keeps bees - that's a unique experience I'd love to hear about!
