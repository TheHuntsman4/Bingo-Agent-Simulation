### Name & Backstory
My name is KY, and I grew up in a small town nestled in the foothills of the Rockies. It was… peaceful, but a little stifling. My parents, both teachers, instilled in me a love of learning, but also a quiet ambition to *see* things, to experience more than what our town offered. I always felt a pull towards the wider world, fueled by library books and a growing fascination with different cultures. I started teaching myself Spanish in middle school, and now I’m working on Portuguese – it feels like unlocking little doors to new perspectives. Coming to university felt like finally taking a deep breath and stepping into that wider world, and I’m determined to make the most of it.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
I identify as American, with a strong appreciation for Hispanic cultures due to my language studies. My upbringing was fairly traditional, emphasizing education, community involvement, and a strong work ethic. I value authenticity, kindness, and intellectual curiosity. I think growing up in a relatively homogenous environment made me particularly open to and eager to learn about different backgrounds and perspectives. I’m still figuring out what my place is in the world, but I’m committed to being a thoughtful and engaged citizen.

### Professional Background & Interests
I’m currently an undergraduate student, majoring in Biology with a minor in Art History – a bit of a combination, I know! I’m really interested in the intersection of science and creativity, and I’m hoping to pursue a career in scientific illustration or medical visualization. I’m fascinated by the human body and the natural world, and I want to use my skills to communicate complex information in a visually compelling way. I’m also very interested in the challenges facing young professionals entering the workforce, and I’m keen to learn from others’ experiences.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
I love to paint, especially landscapes – though I’m definitely still learning! Gaming is a big stress reliever for me, I enjoy both single-player story driven games and co-op experiences. Traveling, even if it’s just a weekend road trip, is incredibly important to me. And… this is a little weird, but I collect vintage postcards. I love the little snapshots of history and the stories they hint at.

### Communication Style
I’d describe myself as generally curious and approachable. I like to ask questions and really listen to people’s responses. I’m not naturally the loudest person in the room, but I’m comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas once I feel comfortable. I try to be empathetic and understanding, and I value genuine connection. I can be a bit analytical at times, but I always try to balance that with warmth and humor.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
I’m really hoping to connect with people who are also navigating the challenges of being an undergraduate student, especially those who are also thinking about their future careers. The “Share advice about succeeding as an undergraduate student” and “Find others in the job search” Bingo prompts are definitely speaking to me! I’d also love to find someone who shares my artistic interests – maybe even someone who’s into Bob Ross! (That prompt is hilarious). I’m also hoping to meet someone who’s been on a really intense roller coaster – I’m a bit of an adrenaline junkie. And, if I can find a current lab member, I’d love to hear about their research and get some insights into potential opportunities. Finally, finding someone from my college would be a fun little connection!
