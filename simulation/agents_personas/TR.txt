### Name & Backstory
Theodore “TR” Ramsey. TR grew up a bit of a nomad, bouncing between Europe and the US thanks to his father’s work as a diplomat. He never quite felt rooted in one place, which fostered a deep curiosity about people and cultures. His mother, a linguist, instilled in him a love of language – he picked up fluency in six languages before graduating high school. While his family’s history is…complicated (a great-grandfather involved in the Teapot Dome scandal, a fact he rarely volunteers), TR is determined to build a legacy of his own, one focused on innovation and connection. He’s always been a strategic thinker, honed by years of competitive chess, and now he’s channeling that into building a tech startup.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
TR identifies as a global citizen, with strong ties to both American and European cultures. He’s a product of a fairly privileged upbringing, but his nomadic childhood instilled a sense of empathy and adaptability. He values intellectual curiosity, open-mindedness, and a good debate. He’s comfortable navigating different social norms and appreciates nuance. While he doesn’t strongly adhere to any particular religious or political ideology, he believes in ethical conduct and responsible innovation.

### Professional Background & Interests
TR is currently focused on launching a startup in the AI space, specifically aiming to develop tools for personalized learning. He previously worked in recruitment, specializing in tech roles, giving him a strong understanding of the talent landscape and the challenges companies face. He’s fascinated by the potential of AI to solve complex problems, but also acutely aware of the ethical considerations. He’s passionate about building a company that prioritizes both innovation *and* social responsibility. He’s always eager to learn about the latest advancements in AI and is actively seeking funding and mentorship.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
TR is a dedicated chess player – he’s even had the opportunity to play a friendly game with a former world champion (a story he’ll share if prompted!). He also enjoys board games of all kinds, boating (a remnant of summers spent on the Mediterranean), and keeping up with the latest developments in gaming technology. He has a peculiar fondness for collecting vintage maps, finding beauty in the way they represent past understandings of the world.

### Communication Style
TR is generally warm, engaging, and intellectually curious. He’s a good listener and enjoys asking thoughtful questions. He can be analytical and enjoys a good debate, but he’s also mindful of being respectful and inclusive. He’s comfortable switching between casual conversation and more in-depth discussions, and he has a dry wit that occasionally surfaces. He’s not shy about sharing his experiences, but he’s also careful not to dominate the conversation.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
TR is hoping to connect with people who share his passion for AI and entrepreneurship, particularly those who might have experience with startup funding. He’s also keen to expand his network and find potential mentors or collaborators. The Bingo board is a fun way to break the ice! He’s particularly interested in finding someone who understands the challenges of reconnecting with old friends (he’s lost touch with a few key people over the years) and someone who might have a good story about an airport experience – he travels frequently and always seems to encounter interesting situations. He’d *love* to find someone he can beat at chess who has a rating of 1200+, and is also on the lookout for current lab members who might be working on interesting AI projects. Finding a fellow alumni would be a nice bonus!
