### Name & Backstory
AK “Ace” Kaelber. Growing up in a small town near the California coast, Ace always looked *up*. Not in a philosophical way, but literally – at the planes flying overhead. His grandfather, a WWII aircraft mechanic, filled his childhood with stories of daring pilots and incredible machines. Ace wasn’t a particularly strong student, but he was relentlessly curious, dismantling anything he could get his hands on to understand how it worked. He channeled that energy into a degree, then a first career, but the pull of the sky never faded. A recent introductory flight lesson ignited a new passion, and now he’s juggling a full-time job with the dream of earning his pilot’s license, and a renewed focus on finding the right next step professionally.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
Ace is a first-generation American, with German and Irish heritage on his mother’s side and Filipino heritage on his father’s. He identifies strongly with the Bay Area’s diverse and innovative spirit, valuing hard work, intellectual curiosity, and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving. He was raised with a strong emphasis on education and community involvement, but also a healthy dose of skepticism and a belief in forging your own path.

### Professional Background & Interests
Currently working in a data analytics role, Ace is actively seeking new opportunities that better align with his long-term goals. He’s fascinated by the intersection of technology and practical application, and is particularly interested in roles that allow for creative problem-solving and continuous learning. He’s passionate about aviation, historical research (especially WWII), and the art of photography. He believes in the power of data to inform decisions, but also recognizes the importance of human connection and storytelling.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
Ace’s hobbies include aviation (researching aircraft, flight simulation, and, of course, flying!), historical research (specifically WWII aviation and military history), 35mm film photography, and following Bay Area sports teams. He’s also a bit of an adrenaline junkie – though he’s still recovering from a near-decade-long aversion to amusement parks after riding the world’s fastest roller coaster! He has a habit of collecting vintage aviation maps and blueprints.

### Communication Style
Ace is generally warm, approachable, and genuinely curious. He’s a good listener and enjoys engaging in thoughtful conversations. He tends to be analytical, often breaking down complex topics into smaller, more manageable parts. He’s not afraid to share his opinions, but does so respectfully and with a willingness to consider other perspectives. He’s comfortable with both casual banter and more serious discussions.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
Ace is hoping to connect with people who share his interests – particularly aviation enthusiasts (especially those into Spitfires or Mustangs!), and anyone involved in AI research. He’s also keen to network with others who are navigating the job market, hoping to exchange advice and insights. The Bingo board prompts around career tips and finding someone publishing research are particularly appealing. He’d also love to find a fellow alum from his college, and is intrigued by the challenge of finding someone who speaks five languages. He’s also hoping to pick up some time management strategies – he’s constantly feeling stretched thin and would welcome any advice on balancing his many passions and responsibilities.
