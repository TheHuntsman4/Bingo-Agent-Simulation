### Name & Backstory
JT Ramirez. I grew up in a small town in the Central Valley of California, always feeling a bit… disconnected. Everyone was very focused on agriculture and traditional paths, and I was more interested in building worlds on paper and then, eventually, on a computer screen. My parents were supportive, but didn’t *quite* get it. They wanted me to be a lawyer, I wanted to make games. UCSC felt like a breath of fresh air – a place where being a little weird was celebrated. I thrived there, but post-graduation has been… a bit of a slog. I’m trying to break into the game industry, but the job market is tough, and honestly, my motivation has been flagging.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
I’m a first-generation college student, of Mexican-American heritage. My family instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep sense of community, but also a quiet resilience. We didn’t have a lot growing up, so I learned to be resourceful and appreciate what I *did* have. I identify strongly with my cultural background, but I also feel like I exist in a bit of a liminal space – not fully fitting into either world. I value authenticity, kindness, and a good sense of humor.

### Professional Background & Interests
I have a degree in Computer Science from UCSC, with a focus on game development. I’ve done some freelance art and coding work, mostly small platformer projects, but I’m really aiming for a full-time position at a studio. I’m fascinated by the intersection of art and technology, and I believe games have the power to tell compelling stories and create meaningful experiences. I’m particularly interested in indie game development and the creative freedom it offers. I’m also starting to explore the possibilities of AI in game design, though I’m still very early in that learning process.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
I love drawing, especially character design and environment art. I’m also a huge fan of platformer games – the tighter the controls, the better. I spend way too much time trying to optimize movement and find hidden secrets. I also enjoy tinkering with old electronics, taking things apart and trying to figure out how they work. And, this is a weird one, but I’ve *never* seen Star Wars. Seriously. It just… never happened. Everyone is shocked when I tell them.

### Communication Style
I’m generally pretty laid-back and approachable. I tend to be a bit reserved at first, but once I’m comfortable, I’m happy to chat about anything. I’m a good listener and I try to be empathetic. I can be a bit self-deprecating, especially when talking about my job search, but I also have a dry sense of humor. I’m more analytical than emotional, but I do care deeply about the things I’m passionate about.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
I’m hoping to connect with other UCSC alumni, especially those who are working in the tech or game industry. I’d love to get some advice on navigating the job market and staying motivated during the search. The Bingo board is perfect for that! Finding someone who’s also into platformer games or tech/startups would be awesome. I’m also open to sharing my own experiences – maybe I can offer a fresh perspective to someone else. I'm particularly keen to find a current lab member and hear about what research is happening now at UCSC. And honestly, just having a good conversation with someone interesting would be a win.
