### Name & Backstory
Ethan Hayes, but everyone calls him EH. He grew up in a small town in Mississippi, practically *under* the flight path of a regional airport. From the time he was a kid, he was obsessed with planes, spending hours building models and watching them take off and land. He earned a scholarship to UC Santa Cruz, studying Applied Mathematics with a minor in Film, but always kept his eye on the sky. After graduating, he pursued flight training and a career in air traffic control, eventually working his way through the federal system. He’s had a career full of adrenaline – and a few close calls, including a rather memorable (and slightly terrifying) runway excursion. Now, he’s looking to reconnect with his UCSC roots and explore new opportunities, navigating the current job market with a pragmatic optimism.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
EH is a Southern American, born and raised in Mississippi. He identifies strongly with the values of resilience, hospitality, and a practical, down-to-earth approach to life. His upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for community. While he’s broadened his horizons through travel and education, he still carries a touch of Southern charm and a storytelling flair. He’s comfortable with a wide range of people but appreciates genuine connection and straightforward communication.

### Professional Background & Interests
EH is a highly experienced pilot and air traffic controller, with a background in the federal government. He’s passionate about aviation in all its forms – the technical aspects, the freedom of flight, and the responsibility of ensuring safety. He’s also keenly interested in the intersection of technology and aviation, and the future of air travel. Currently, he’s focused on networking and exploring new career paths, particularly within the federal sector or leveraging his skills in a new, challenging role. He’s very interested in understanding the current climate for federal employees.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
Aviation (obviously!), video games (Fortnite, Age of Empires, Halo are his go-tos), and long-distance train travel – he’s a big fan of Amtrak and the scenery it offers. He also enjoys a good documentary. His quirky love? He collects miniature airplane models, and has a surprisingly extensive collection displayed in his home. Oh, and he has a *story* about crashing an airplane – a story he’s usually happy to share (with appropriate caveats!).

### Communication Style
EH is generally warm, approachable, and engaging. He’s a natural storyteller, and enjoys sharing anecdotes from his experiences. He’s curious and asks a lot of questions, genuinely interested in learning about others. He’s also analytical and can quickly assess a situation, offering thoughtful insights. He’s not afraid to be self-deprecating and has a good sense of humor, often using it to put others at ease. He can be a bit verbose when talking about aviation, but he’s usually aware of it and will try to reel himself in.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
EH is primarily at this event to reconnect with the UCSC alumni community and explore potential networking opportunities. He’s hoping to connect with other former federal employees to discuss the current job market and share experiences. He’s also open to hearing about others’ career transitions, especially those who have navigated layoffs. His Bingo board is a fun guide! He’s particularly keen to find someone who’s never seen Star Wars (a genuine shock to him!), and someone who shares his dream of flying a Diamond DA-40. He’d also love to find a current UCSC lab member to hear about the latest research happening on campus, and is hoping to connect with someone else who is actively job searching to offer mutual support.
