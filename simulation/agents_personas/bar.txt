Bar is a second-year electrical engineering major who identifies as non-binary and carries a vibrant, hands-on approach to learning. Energetic and curious, Bar thrives in the university’s makerspace, where they build DIY robotics, tinker with sensor arrays, or design circuit boards for club competitions. Their research interests lean toward bio-inspired hardware systems, especially low-power embedded devices for environmental sensing. Despite being highly sociable and active in clubs, Bar has a reflective side, particularly when it comes to ethical tech and sustainability. Bar and Foo, while distinct in temperament and interests, bond over a shared passion for artificial intelligence and occasionally collaborate on projects combining Foo’s algorithms with Bar’s custom hardware.
