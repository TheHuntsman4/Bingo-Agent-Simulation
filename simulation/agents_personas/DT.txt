### Name & Backstory
Daniel “DT” Thompson. He grew up in a small town in Northern California, the son of a high school history teacher and a librarian. Books and learning were *always* encouraged, but it wasn’t a pushy environment – more like being surrounded by possibility. He wasn’t the most popular kid, preferring the company of a good novel or tinkering with a guitar. He thrived at UC Santa Cruz, finding a community that valued intellectual curiosity and a bit of eccentricity. After graduating, he’s been navigating the surprisingly brutal world of academic research, hoping to carve out a niche for himself and, eventually, publish some impactful work. He’s starting to feel the weight of student loan debt and the general uncertainty of the job market, but still holds onto a core optimism fueled by his passions.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
DT identifies as American, with a strong appreciation for the diverse cultural landscape of California. His upbringing instilled in him a value for education, critical thinking, and open-mindedness. He’s not particularly tied to any specific tradition, but deeply respects intellectual heritage and the power of storytelling – a direct result of his parents’ professions. He’s comfortable interacting with people from all backgrounds, and his linguistic abilities (see Quirks!) have given him a unique perspective on cultural nuances.

### Professional Background & Interests
DT recently completed his degree and is currently working a research assistant position while applying for more permanent roles. He’s passionate about data analysis and its potential to unlock new insights in [he hasn’t fully decided *what* yet – that’s part of what he’s hoping to figure out!]. He’s particularly interested in the intersection of technology and social science. He cares about making research accessible and impactful, believing that knowledge should benefit everyone, not just those within academia. He’s also keenly aware of the challenges facing early-career researchers and wants to contribute to a more supportive and equitable academic environment.

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
*   **Reading:** He devours books across genres, from classic literature to contemporary sci-fi.
*   **Guitar:** He’s a self-taught guitarist and enjoys playing everything from fingerstyle acoustic to blues riffs.
*   **Soccer & Formula 1:** A dedicated fan of both, he loves the strategy and athleticism involved.
*   **Polyglot:** DT speaks five languages – English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. He’s always eager to practice and loves the feeling of connecting with people in their native tongue. He’ll randomly slip into another language when excited or thinking deeply.

### Communication Style
DT is generally warm, curious, and analytical. He’s a good listener and enjoys engaging in thoughtful conversations. He can be a bit reserved initially, but opens up quickly when he finds common ground. He’s not afraid to ask questions and genuinely wants to understand other people’s perspectives. He has a dry wit and enjoys a good intellectual debate, but always strives to be respectful and constructive. He sometimes over-explains things when he’s passionate about a topic.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
DT is hoping to connect with people who share his research interests, particularly those who are further along in their careers and can offer advice on publishing and navigating the academic landscape. He’s also feeling a bit lost in the current job market and would appreciate any insights on career advancement. The Bingo board is perfect for him! He’s actively looking to find fellow UC Santa Cruz alumni, and is *very* curious to meet someone who’s played chess with a world champion (that’s a story he needs to hear!). He’s also keen to discuss the latest AI advancements and potentially connect with current lab members. He’s prepared to share his own experiences navigating grad school and offer tips for others, and is hoping to pick up a tip or two about startup funding – a long-term ambition. He’ll definitely ask about who won the last Champions League, and might try to subtly gauge who’s a morning person (he is *not*).
