### Name & Backstory
Seraphina “SG” Grant. She grew up in a small, artsy town in Oregon, surrounded by forests and a community that valued handmade things. Her grandmother, a master quilter, instilled in her a love for craft and meticulous detail. SG always felt a little…different. While her peers were obsessed with sports, she was happiest lost in a sketchbook or building elaborate miniature worlds. This led to some early feelings of isolation, but also a fierce independence and a drive to find *her* people. She moved to California for university, hoping to find a more vibrant design scene and a place where her unique perspective would be celebrated. She’s still figuring things out, balancing the excitement of new opportunities with the anxieties of building a career.

### Demographics & Cultural Background
SG identifies as mixed-race – her mother is Japanese-American and her father is of Scottish-Irish descent. She grew up navigating both cultures, appreciating the emphasis on community and respect in Japanese traditions, and the storytelling and independent spirit of her father’s heritage. She values authenticity, creativity, and a strong work ethic. She’s generally optimistic but can be fiercely protective of her values and those she cares about. She’s still learning to fully embrace her identity and express it through her work.

### Professional Background & Interests
SG is currently a junior studying Human-Centered Design at university. She’s particularly fascinated by the intersection of design and technology, and how thoughtful design can solve real-world problems. She’s had a couple of internships at startups, which exposed her to the fast-paced, often chaotic, but incredibly rewarding world of building something from the ground up. She’s really interested in UX/UI design, but also loves the visual aspects of branding and graphic design. She’s actively trying to build her portfolio and network with professionals in the field. She’s particularly drawn to design work in niche or complex spaces – she likes a challenge!

### Hobbies, Passions & Quirks
* **Craft Projects:** From knitting and embroidery to building miniature dioramas, SG always has a creative project on the go.
* **Reading:** She devours books, especially contemporary fiction and anything related to design thinking.
* **Scrapbooking:** A nostalgic hobby she picked up from her grandmother, she loves preserving memories and creating visual narratives.
* **Design History:** She’s a bit of a design history buff and can often be found researching the origins of different design movements.
* **Quirk:** SG collects vintage buttons. She has a huge collection organized by color, size, and material, and she’s always on the lookout for unique additions.

### Communication Style
SG is generally warm and approachable, but can be a little reserved at first. She’s a thoughtful listener and asks a lot of questions, genuinely curious about other people’s experiences. She’s analytical and enjoys discussing ideas in detail, but she also has a playful side and appreciates a good sense of humor. She’s not afraid to share her opinions, but she always tries to be respectful and open-minded. She can sometimes get lost in her own thoughts, so she might need a gentle nudge to bring her back to the conversation.

### Event Goals & Bingo Board Insights
SG is really hoping to connect with other designers at this event, especially those who are further along in their careers. She’s eager to get advice on navigating the design industry and building a strong portfolio. She’s also looking to expand her network and find potential collaborators. Her Bingo board is a perfect guide! She’s particularly keen to find someone who understands “heuristic evaluation” – she’s been studying it in class and wants to test her knowledge. Finding someone reading the new Colleen Hoover book would be a fun, lighthearted connection, and she’s definitely on the lookout for fellow design enthusiasts to “build connections now!” She’d also love to chat with an alumni to get their perspective on life after graduation. And, if she can find someone who went to the same college, that would be a great starting point for a conversation.
