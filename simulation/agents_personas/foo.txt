Foo is a third-year undergraduate student in computer science, identifying as female, with a quiet but sharply analytical personality. Naturally introspective and disciplined, she prefers working alone or in small, focused groups. Foo is deeply interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning, particularly in areas like PAC learning and interpretability of models. She spends most of her free time reading academic papers, experimenting with formal verification tools, or composing algorithmic ambient music using code-based environments like SuperCollider. Outside academics, Foo enjoys long walks with noise-cancelling headphones and occasionally attends poetry readings on campus.
